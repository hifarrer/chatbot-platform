# About TEMPLATE_knowledge_base_structure.json

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - READ THIS FIRST

**This file is a TEMPLATE for documentation purposes ONLY.**

## What This File Is

`TEMPLATE_knowledge_base_structure.json` is a **reference file** that shows developers the structure of a knowledge base. It demonstrates:
- The JSON schema format
- How facts are organized
- How QA patterns work
- Example field names and types

## What This File Is NOT

‚ùå **This file is NOT used in chatbot training**  
‚ùå **This file is NOT loaded by the system**  
‚ùå **This file does NOT contain real training data**  
‚ùå **No information from this file is used in any chatbot**

## How Chatbots Are Actually Trained

When you train a chatbot:

1. ‚úÖ You upload YOUR documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
2. ‚úÖ System extracts text from YOUR documents
3. ‚úÖ System sends YOUR document text to OpenAI
4. ‚úÖ OpenAI generates a knowledge base from YOUR content ONLY
5. ‚úÖ Knowledge base is saved for YOUR chatbot

**At no point is the template file loaded, read, or referenced.**

## Verification

You can verify this by checking the code:

### In `services/chatbot_trainer.py`:

```python
def generate_knowledge_base(self, text, chatbot_info=None):
    """
    IMPORTANT: This method generates a knowledge base ONLY from the provided document text.
    It does NOT use any sample data or templates - only the structure format is specified.
    The TEMPLATE_knowledge_base_structure.json file is for reference/documentation only 
    and is NEVER loaded or used.
    """
```

The method:
- ‚úÖ Takes YOUR document text as input
- ‚úÖ Sends ONLY your text to OpenAI
- ‚ùå Does NOT load any template files
- ‚ùå Does NOT reference any sample data

### The OpenAI Prompt Explicitly States:

```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- You MUST extract information ONLY from the document text provided below
- DO NOT use any example data, sample data, or placeholder information
- DO NOT invent or fabricate any information not present in the documents
```

## Questions?

**Q: Will my chatbot know about "Owlbee.AI" if I don't upload Owlbee documents?**  
A: No. The template file is never used. Your chatbot only knows what's in YOUR documents.

**Q: How can I be sure the template isn't used?**  
A: Check the code in `services/chatbot_trainer.py` - there's no file loading code, only text processing.

**Q: Can I delete this template file?**  
A: Yes, you can delete it without affecting chatbot training. It's purely for documentation.

**Q: What if I want to use this template as a starting point?**  
A: You can't - and shouldn't. Upload YOUR actual documents instead. The system will create a knowledge base from your content automatically.
