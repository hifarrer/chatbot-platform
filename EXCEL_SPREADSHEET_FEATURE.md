# Excel Spreadsheet Training Feature

## Overview

The chatbot platform now supports training with **Excel (.xlsx) files**, enabling you to train your chatbot with structured data from spreadsheets. This is perfect for:

- Product catalogs
- Pricing tables
- Plan comparison tables
- Feature matrices
- Inventory data
- FAQ databases
- Any tabular data

## How It Works

Excel files are processed similarly to Google Sheets:

1. **Data Extraction**: The system reads all sheets in the Excel workbook
2. **Structured Conversion**: Each sheet is converted to structured JSON format
3. **Dual Format**: Data is formatted in both:
   - **JSON format** - for structured understanding by AI
   - **Human-readable format** - for natural language processing
4. **AI Training**: The formatted data is sent to OpenAI to generate a knowledge base

## Supported Features

### ‚úÖ Multiple Sheets
- Processes all sheets in a workbook
- Each sheet is converted separately and combined

### ‚úÖ Header Detection
- Automatically uses the first row as column headers
- Skips empty columns

### ‚úÖ Data Cleaning
- Removes empty rows
- Trims whitespace
- Handles various data types (text, numbers, dates)

### ‚úÖ Structured Output
The Excel data is converted to a format like:

```
=== Google Sheet: Products ===
Total Rows: 5
Columns: Product Name, Price, Description, Category

=== Structured Data (JSON Format) ===
{
  "sheet_name": "Products",
  "columns": ["Product Name", "Price", "Description", "Category"],
  "row_count": 5,
  "data": [
    {
      "Product Name": "Basic Plan",
      "Price": "$9.99",
      "Description": "Perfect for individuals",
      "Category": "Subscription"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

=== Human-Readable Format ===

Entry 1:
  Product Name: Basic Plan
  Price: $9.99
  Description: Perfect for individuals
  Category: Subscription

...
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Product Catalog Training
Upload an Excel file with columns like:
- Product Name
- Price
- Description
- Features
- SKU

The chatbot can then answer questions like:
- "What products do you offer?"
- "How much does [product name] cost?"
- "What are the features of [product name]?"

### 2. Pricing Plans
Upload a comparison table with:
- Plan Name
- Monthly Price
- Annual Price
- Features
- User Limits

The chatbot can answer:
- "What plans are available?"
- "What's included in the Pro plan?"
- "What's the difference between Basic and Pro?"

### 3. Feature Comparison
Upload a matrix showing:
- Feature names in rows
- Plan/product names in columns
- Yes/No or detailed values in cells

### 4. FAQ Database
Structure your FAQ as:
- Question column
- Answer column
- Category column

## How to Upload Excel Files

1. Navigate to your chatbot's **Details** page
2. Go to the **Training Documents** section
3. Click the **File Upload** tab
4. Select your `.xlsx` file
5. Click **Upload Document**

The system will:
- Extract all data from all sheets
- Convert to structured format
- Generate an AI knowledge base
- Train your chatbot

## File Requirements

- **Format**: `.xlsx` (Excel 2007 and later)
- **Size Limit**: Based on your subscription plan
- **Structure**: First row should be headers
- **Data**: Can contain text, numbers, dates, formulas (values only)

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- `openpyxl>=3.0.0` - Python library for reading/writing Excel files

### Processing Method
The Excel processor:
1. Loads the workbook in read-only mode with `data_only=True` (shows formula results)
2. Iterates through all sheets
3. Extracts rows and identifies headers
4. Converts to structured JSON
5. Formats for AI training with both JSON and text representations

### Code Location
- **Processor**: `services/document_processor.py`
  - `_process_xlsx()` - Main Excel processing method
  - `_excel_to_structured_json()` - Converts to structured format
  - `_format_sheet_for_training()` - Formats for AI (shared with Google Sheets)

## Supported File Types

The platform now supports:
- **PDF** (`.pdf`) - Extract text from PDF documents
- **Word** (`.docx`) - Extract text from Word documents
- **Text** (`.txt`) - Plain text files
- **JSON** (`.json`) - Structured JSON data
- **Excel** (`.xlsx`) - Spreadsheet data (NEW!)

Plus remote sources:
- **Google Docs** - Via shareable link
- **Google Sheets** - Via shareable link

## Example Workflow

### Creating a Product Knowledge Base

1. **Prepare your Excel file**:
   ```
   | Product Name    | Price   | Description           | Category      |
   |-----------------|---------|----------------------|---------------|
   | Basic Plan      | $9.99   | For individuals      | Subscription  |
   | Pro Plan        | $29.99  | For small teams      | Subscription  |
   | Enterprise Plan | $99.99  | For organizations    | Subscription  |
   ```

2. **Upload the file** through the chatbot dashboard

3. **Training happens automatically**:
   - OpenAI analyzes the structured data
   - Creates semantic understanding
   - Generates Q&A patterns
   - Builds knowledge base

4. **Chatbot is ready**:
   - Can answer questions about products
   - Understands pricing
   - Knows product differences
   - Provides accurate information

## Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Use clear, descriptive column headers
- Keep data clean and consistent
- Use one header row at the top
- Include all relevant information
- Group related data in separate sheets

### ‚ùå Avoid:
- Merged cells (may cause parsing issues)
- Complex formulas (only values are read)
- Empty header cells
- Multiple header rows
- Excessive formatting (only data is extracted)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No data found in Excel file"
**Solution**: Ensure your Excel file has at least one non-empty row with headers and data.

### Issue: "Error processing Excel file"
**Possible causes**:
- File is corrupted
- File is password-protected (not supported)
- File is too large
- File uses unsupported Excel features

**Solution**: Try opening the file in Excel, save a fresh copy, and upload again.

### Issue: "Some columns are missing"
**Solution**: Make sure all header cells in the first row have values. Empty header cells are skipped.

## Performance

- **Small files** (< 100 rows): Process in seconds
- **Medium files** (100-1000 rows): Process in 10-30 seconds
- **Large files** (> 1000 rows): May take 1-2 minutes

Processing time depends on:
- Number of sheets
- Number of rows
- Complexity of data
- OpenAI API response time

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Support for `.xls` (older Excel format)
- Custom sheet selection
- Advanced data validation
- Column type detection
- Relationship mapping between sheets
- Excel formula evaluation
