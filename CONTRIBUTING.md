## Logging

New code logs through `services.logging_setup`, not `print()`:

```python
from services.logging_setup import get_logger, RunLogger

log = RunLogger(get_logger('owlbee.training'), run_id=run_id, chatbot_id=chatbot.id)
log.event('training.started', doc_count=3)
```

Output is JSON on Render (set `LOG_FORMAT=json`) and human-readable locally.
The existing `print()` calls are legacy and are being left alone; don't add new
ones. Never log document text, knowledge-base content, prompts, or visitor
messages - lengths, counts and ids only.
