### Example: Pricing Plans Sheet

**Your Google Sheet:**
| Plan Name    | Price      | Features           | Max Chatbots |
|--------------|------------|--------------------|--------------|
| Free Plan    | $0         | Basic features     | 1            |
| Starter Plan | $29/month  | Advanced features  | 5            |
| Pro Plan     | $99/month  | All features       | Unlimited    |

**Becomes this training data:**
```
=== Google Sheet: Main Sheet ===
Total Rows: 3
Columns: Plan Name, Price, Features, Max Chatbots

=== Structured Data (JSON Format) ===
{
  "sheet_name": "Main Sheet",
  "columns": ["Plan Name", "Price", "Features", "Max Chatbots"],
  "row_count": 3,
  "data": [
    {
      "Plan Name": "Free Plan",
      "Price": "$0",
      "Features": "Basic features",
      "Max Chatbots": "1"
    },
    {
      "Plan Name": "Starter Plan",
      "Price": "$29/month",
      "Features": "Advanced features",
      "Max Chatbots": "5"
    },
    {
      "Plan Name": "Pro Plan",
      "Price": "$99/month",
      "Features": "All features",
      "Max Chatbots": "Unlimited"
    }
  ]
}

=== Human-Readable Format ===

Entry 1:
  Plan Name: Free Plan
  Price: $0
  Features: Basic features
  Max Chatbots: 1

Entry 2:
  Plan Name: Starter Plan
  Price: $29/month
  Features: Advanced features
  Max Chatbots: 5

Entry 3:
  Plan Name: Pro Plan
  Price: $99/month
  Features: All features
  Max Chatbots: Unlimited
```

**Result:** Your chatbot can now answer:
- "What are your pricing plans?"
- "How much does the Pro plan cost?"
- "What's included in the Starter plan?"
- "Can I create multiple chatbots on the Free plan?"

## üîê Sharing Permissions (Important!)

Both Google Docs and Google Sheets must be publicly accessible:

### How to Share:
1. Open your Google Doc or Sheet
2. Click the **"Share"** button (top-right)
3. Under "General access", change from **"Restricted"** to **"Anyone with the link"**
4. Set permission to **"Viewer"**
5. Click **"Done"**

### Why Public Sharing?
The platform fetches documents on behalf of your chatbot without user authentication. Public sharing allows the system to access your content securely via the URL.

### Security Note:
- Only people with the exact link can access
- Link is not indexed by search engines
- You can revoke access anytime by changing back to "Restricted"

## üí° Best Practices

### For Google Docs:
- Use clear headings and structure
- Break content into logical sections
- Include common questions and answers
- Use consistent formatting
- Avoid tables (use Google Sheets instead)

### For Google Sheets:
- **First row = column headers** (required)
- Use descriptive header names
- Keep data clean (no merged cells)
- One type of data per sheet
- Remove empty rows
- Use consistent formatting

### Combination Strategy:
- **Google Docs**: Brand story, policies, how-to guides
- **Google Sheets**: Pricing, products, structured FAQs
- **Local Files**: PDFs, large documents, legacy content

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error
**Solution**: Ensure document is shared with "Anyone with the link can view"

### "Document Not Found" Error
**Solution**: Check the URL is correct and document still exists

### "Empty Content" Warning
**Solution**: 
- Google Docs: Add text content to document
- Google Sheets: Ensure at least one row of data (besides headers)

### Chatbot Not Understanding Sheets Data
**Solution**: 
- Use clear column headers
- Ensure data is in first sheet (gid=0)
- Check for empty columns or formatting issues

### Sheet Shows Old Data After Update
**Solution**: Re-import the sheet to fetch latest version
