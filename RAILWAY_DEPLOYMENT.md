# Railway Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ **GitHub**: Changes pushed successfully
⚠️ **Railway**: Deployment needs configuration

## Files Ready for Deployment
- ✅ `app.py` - Application factory pattern
- ✅ `run.py` - Production entry point
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Railway configuration
- ✅ `Procfile` - Process definition

## Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Login with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your `chatbot-platform` repository

### 2. Environment Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard:
```SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key-here
```

### 3. Deployment Configuration
Railway should automatically detect:
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command**: `gunicorn run:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **Port**: Railway provides `$PORT` automatically

### 4. Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue: "Module not found" errors
- Check that all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
- Make sure Railway is installing from the correct requirements file

#### Issue: "App failed to start"
- Check Railway logs for specific error messages
- Verify that `run.py` imports work correctly

#### Issue: "Port binding failed"
- Ensure your app uses `$PORT` environment variable
- Railway automatically provides the correct port

### 5. Check Deployment Status
1. In Railway dashboard, go to your project
2. Click on "Deployments" tab
3. View logs for any error messages
4. Check "Settings" → "Environment" for variables

### 6. Testing
Once deployed, test:
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Homepage**: `https://your-app.railway.app/`

## Current Configuration

### railway.toml
```toml
[build]
builder = "nixpacks"

[deploy]
startCommand = "gunicorn run:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 100
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10
```

### Procfile
```
web: gunicorn run:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

## Next Steps
1. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
2. View logs if deployment failed
3. Set SECRET_KEY environment variable
4. Test the health endpoint

## Support
If you encounter issues:
1. Check Railway logs first
2. Verify all files are committed to GitHub
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly
