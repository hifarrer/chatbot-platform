ChatBot Platform - Complete User Guide and Documentation

What is the ChatBot Platform?
The ChatBot Platform is a powerful web application that allows users to create, train, and deploy AI-powered chatbots using their own documents and data. It combines local AI processing with OpenAI's GPT technology to provide intelligent, context-aware responses based on your specific training materials.

Key Features and Capabilities

What can the ChatBot Platform do?
- Create unlimited custom chatbots for different purposes
- Train chatbots using PDF, DOCX, and TXT documents
- Generate intelligent responses using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo
- Provide embeddable widgets for websites
- Track conversation history and analytics
- Support multiple users with secure authentication
- Process documents automatically with advanced text extraction
- Generate similarity-based context for accurate responses

How does the AI training work?
The platform uses a hybrid approach combining local sentence transformers with OpenAI's GPT technology. When you upload documents, the system extracts text, splits it into meaningful sentences, generates embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model, and stores this data for fast similarity matching. When users ask questions, the system finds relevant content and sends it to OpenAI GPT for natural language generation.

What types of documents can I upload?
You can train your chatbots with:
- PDF files (automatically extracts text from all pages)
- Microsoft Word documents (DOCX format)
- Plain text files (TXT format)
- Maximum file size is 16MB per document
- You can upload multiple documents per chatbot
- Documents are processed automatically with smart sentence splitting

Getting Started Guide

How do I create my first chatbot?
1. Register for an account on the platform
2. Log in to access your dashboard
3. Click "Create New Chatbot"

Technical Specifications

What AI technology powers the chatbots?
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for natural language generation
- Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for text embeddings
- Cosine similarity matching for content retrieval
- Advanced document processing with PyPDF2 and python-docx
- Flask web framework with SQLAlchemy database
- Real-time response generation with context awareness

How accurate are the chatbot responses?
Response accuracy depends on:
- Quality and relevance of training documents
- Specificity of user questions
- Amount of training data provided
- Similarity threshold settings (typically 0.2-0.8)
The system uses a relevance scoring system to ensure high-quality responses.

What are the system requirements?
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection for OpenAI API access
- JavaScript enabled for embed functionality
- No special software installation required
- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

Pricing and API Usage

How much does it cost to use?
The platform itself is free to use. However, you need:
- An OpenAI API key for GPT responses
- OpenAI charges approximately $0.002 per 1000 tokens
- Typical conversation costs $0.01-0.05 per exchange
- Local similarity matching is free and unlimited

What happens if I reach API limits?
If OpenAI API fails or limits are reached:
- The system automatically falls back to local similarity matching
- Users still get responses based on training data
- No conversations are lost or interrupted
- You can upgrade your OpenAI plan for higher limits
